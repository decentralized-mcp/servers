# OpenMCP servers

In this repo, we have a collection of "community contributed" OpenMCP services that works with any MCP compatible LLM application or framework.

* The [example](example/) folder contains "quick start" examples on how to set up and use the OpenMCP tools.
* The [pr-reviewer](pr-reviewer/) folder provides MCP tools to get content from a GitHub Pull Request (PR) and review the PR using your own fine-tuned LLM.
* The [podcast_maker](podcast_maker/) folder provides MCP tools to generate a podcast-style animated video from text.
